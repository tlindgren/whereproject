Today Cathy sent me alink to this amazing photo of an albino squirrel near Jamaica pond taken by [cottenmanifesto](http://cottonmanifesto.livejournal.com/)  and posted at [Loving Nature While Living in the City](http://community.livejournal.com/urban_nature). Apparently its existence dominated the lunch conversation at her work today.

The life of a squirrel can be a precarious one, as I witnessed earlier this evening when I walked out of my office and was met by a red-tailed hawk standing on the sidewalk, talons firmly around a squirrel it had just killed. After a few moments, it flew away, leaving a small pool of blood on the concrete where it has been standing. 

I didn&#039;t realize until reading [Kevin&#039;s blog](http://insidebureaucracytoday.blogspot.com/2008/02/joys-of-bb-ice-is-nice-and-would.html)  this week that bikes can also present a fatal hazard to squirrels, as this photo demonstrates:

These incidents reminded me of the rather conflicted relationship I&#039;ve had with squirrels over the years. I got to know them quite intimately when I llved in Allston, or more precisely, when we lived _together_ in Allson, since they occupied the walls and attic space around my room most of the time I was there. It wasn&#039;t an amicable relationship, I&#039;m afraid; they kept me up at night, gnawned on wires, and chewed through my belongings stored in the attic, so finally I had to begin trapping them so that pest control could pick them up. Ultimately, it was the landlord&#039;s fault since  he wouldn&#039;t fix all the holes in the house, and I resented being forced into this antagonistic relationship with animals that under normal circumstances I&#039;m confident I could get along with quite well. 

But these are the lessons we learn, living together in the city, and I hope to have more pleasant encounters with my neighbor squirrels in the future.
