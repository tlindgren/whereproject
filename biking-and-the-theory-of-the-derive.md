Last night I went on my second ride on my new bike, and since I didn't have much time, I decided to experiment with what I've started to call a &quot;random ride.&quot; In this case, I started out toward Watertown and once I got toward Arsenal Street, I began to make navigational decisions on a whim, with as a little deliberation as possible. This method led me on a 45-minute ride through the winding back streets of Watertown and Brighton in which I tried to stay off the main roads and follow the shifting flow of street patterns and traffic. 

In light of my reading in pyschogeography lately, I realize now that the term &quot;derive&quot; is better than &quot;random&quot; as a way to describe this kind of ride. <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;">[Social Fiction](http://www.socialfiction.org/index.html)</span></font>
describes the <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12pt;">theory of the dérive this way:</span></font>

<font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12pt;">ONE OF
THE BASIC situationist practices is the __<font face="Times New Roman">dérive</font>__ [literally:
&quot;drifting&quot;], a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances.
Dérives involve playful-constructive behavior and awareness of
psychogeographical effects, and are thus quite different from the classic
notions of journey or stroll.</span></font>

<font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a
dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their relations, their
work and leisure activities, and all their other usual motives for movement and
action, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the
encounters they find there. Chance is a less important factor in this activity
than one might think: from a dérive point of view cities have
psychogeographical contours, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes
that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones.&quot;

On future rides, I will start tracking my routes with a gps device and then plot the waypoints on a map that I can put online. Stay tuned....
