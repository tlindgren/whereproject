This evening  I attended a reading by [Naama Goldstein](http://www.naamagoldstein.com/) at the Out of the Blue gallery, and as I parked my bike at the rack across the street, I noticed that a unicycle was locked up next to me--the first time I've had this happen. Only in Central Square Cambridge would someone ride to Whole Foods on a unicycle. It reminded me of the time I watched a guy cruise down Mass Ave through Central Square on a 19th -century style high wheel bike.  It was a beautiful sight.

Somehow the unicyle just made me happy as I rode home along Western Ave, across the Charles River, and down Cambridge Street into Allston.
H.G. Wells said it best:  &quot;When I see an adult on a bicycle, I do not despair for the future of the human race. &quot;
