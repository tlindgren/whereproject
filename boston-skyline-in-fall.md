This morning I was a week ahead for my meeting with [Fred](http://www.fragmentsfromfloyd.com/) at his hotel by MIT. Apparently I got it in my mind that it was this Monday rather than next Monday that we were going to get breakfast, so my mistake gave me a convenient excuse to bike along the Charles on a gorgeous fall morning. All along the way, the city skyline  was framed by trees in color and I had to stop several times to snap photos. Hopefully there will still be some leaves on trees next Monday when I Fred and I actually connect.
