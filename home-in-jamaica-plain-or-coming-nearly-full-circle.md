This morning I&#039;m sitting in Emack and Bolios on Centre Street in Jamaica Plain, working on the introduction to my dissertation. I&#039;ve been working on a section where I describe my experience of dislocation after moving from Chicago to Boston, and how my sense of place there was deepened by working with refugees. I&#039;m quite certain that I&#039;ve ended up in JP because it has always reminded me of my old neighborhood in Rogers Park, and now that I&#039;ve moved here after years wandering in an Allston wilderness for too many years, I feel like this is not just a new beginning but also a kind of homecoming, a return to a sense of urban place that I&#039;ve missed for a long time. 

It&#039;s good to be back.
