Yesterday evening I biked by this tree in Eliott Street Park and couldn't help but stop and take a photo. There wasn't anything subtle about it--just brilliant setting sun on brilliant yellow leaves. It was my first birthday present of the day, and things only go better as I went from there to meet Cathy for a picnic next to Jamaica Pond.
