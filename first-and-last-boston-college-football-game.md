For the next week, I'll be playing tour guide for a visitor from Fargo,
so it gives me an excuse to do some things I haven't had a chance to do
yet as a resident. Despite being at Boston College for numerous years
(for my ego's sake, I prefer not to actully say the number anymore) I
still haven't been to a BC sporting event. It's not that I don't like
sports--I actually play them quite a bit--but I've developed a low
tolerance for watching sports, especially ones that I no longer believe
in.

Case in point--football. Though I played football through 8th grade and
was an avid Vikings fan growing up, I now think it's a sport that takes
too much money and receives too much attention, especially in
university settings. You only have observe the 30 million dollar
building being built just for the football program or the $100,000
dollar check presented during the game this evening to know what's
important around here.

Since I won't be going to any more BC football games, I thought I'd at least get a shot of myself with a sign Joel made for the folks back home. Of course, as modest Scandinavians, we were't self-assertive enough to hold it up much during the game, so this may be the most airtime it gets.
