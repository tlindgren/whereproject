It's been a banner weekend for sports fans here in boston. Not only was the annual Head of the Charles Regatta taking place Saturday and Sunday, but most of the major sports teams added to their W columns in impressive fashion: 

*   The Red Sox won twice against the Cardinals in the World Series
*   The Patriots won their 21st game in a row*   Boston College beat Notre Dame for the fourth straight time
*   The New England Revolution won their conference semifinal game against ColumbusWith all this winning going on, it's easy to forget about the showdown next week between the other Boston team--Team Kerry-- with the Bush League. In the long run, that's the only W that really matters.
