The first copies of [Writing Places: A Longman Topics Reader](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321316851/qid=1115992908/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/103-9635824-0052643?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846) appeared yesterday, a little over a year after Paula, George, Staci, and I started the project. It was a pleasure working with these friends during that time, and I hope the fruits of our long hours spent in Cafenation and the O'Neill study rooms will prove useful for some place-based pedagogues out there.
