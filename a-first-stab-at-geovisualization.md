Tonight I've stayed up too late experimenting with [worldKit](http://www.brainoff.com/worldkit/index.html), a mapping application that has mind-blowing possiblities for connecting place and the web. I've set up a short demo **[here](http://www.timlindgren.org/whereproject/worldkit/boston.htm).**

At this point, I'm hoping that soon I'll  be able to map every new WhereProject post dynamically onto an appropriate map. But really figuring out all the implications of this technology will have to happen sometime after I have had more sleep.
