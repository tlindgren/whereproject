<span class="inline right"> </span><span class="inline right">[](http://www.whereproject.org/node/655)</span>Sunday evening was the annual Lantern Parade at Jamaica Pond, a community event which involves walking around the pond with lanterns lit. Kids come in their costumes, music is playing, a cider press provide fresh apple cider--it's a great scene.

Tonight as I was riding home from work I passed more tricker-treaters in Brookline and JP than I have for as long as I can remember, and I realized that it's been quite some time since I lived in a residental neighborhood with enough families and kids to support conventional Halloween festivities. I didn't think to buy any candy because I just assumed that no-one would be out--this is how warped my perspect got after living in Allston for so long.

Back in my neighbhood, I was delighted to see so many costumed kids out and about and many neighbors sitting out on their front porch with candy to greet the kids. I was disappointed not to participate, but I'm glad to know that the neighborhood does it up right. Next year, I'll be home early and ready, sitting on the porch with the light on and a bucket of candy.
