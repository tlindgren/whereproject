One of the best perks of living in JP is the ride from here to work each morning. The 20-25 minute journey takes me down the backroads of Brookline and Chestnut Hill on what feel like country roads. Along the way I pass three bodies of water, the first of which is Jamaica Pond, the bluest of the jewels in the Olmstead-designed Emerald Necklace. 

According to [The Heart of the City](http://ksgaccman.harvard.edu/hotc/DisplayPlace.asp?id=11379), Jamaica Pond &quot;<span class="h1">largest and purest water body in the City of Boston</span><span class="h1">.&quot; Geologically speaking, it&#039;s a &quot;60-acre kettlehole, which is a water body created by glacial meltwater. Natural springs feed the pond, which is up to 90-feet deep in some sections. According to the 2001 Emerald Necklace Master Plan, the pond has &#039;exceptionally good water quality&#039; (p171).&quot;</span>
