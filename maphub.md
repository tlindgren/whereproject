&quot;MapHub is a web-based, multi-user, group managed information storage system and map. Collecting information about people, places, events, and notes, can help to document unseen narratives and histories in public or private theme-based Hubs. The project is in development.&quot;

This collaborative mapping project looks really interesting, but it appears to be only in it's early stages of development.
