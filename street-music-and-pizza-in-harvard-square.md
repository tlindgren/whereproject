Last night I spend my third evening in Harvard Square this week, and I was glad to find that the square on a summer evening still has its charms, despite the many changes in recent years. Waiting for my friend Marlene—stuck in traffic on the Mass Ave bus—gave the chance to hear [Lisa Bastoni](http://www.lisabastoni.com/home.php) play in front of Out of Town News.<!--break-->

 As I listened, I watched the behavior of passers-by, as I try to encourage my First-Year Writing students to do (“[Music in the Subways](http://www2.bc.edu/%7Elindgret/fws-fall2002/student_pres/Bethany/essay-2-final.htm),” “[Buckets, Pans, and Sticks](http://www.timlindgren.org/fws-2003/document.php?id=267)”). Most people least slowed their pace slightly to get a listen, and many seemed tempted to stop for a while rather than rush off to wherever they were going. One woman stood listening as she read her book and clapped whenever a song finished. Another man walked by and dropped in quarters after stopping for only a moment, as if he felt that just hearing her music in passing was worth paying something for. I stood with my bike leaning against the wall nearby, but I realized after I got settled that I was in awkward position to be a supportive audience, since she had to look way over to the left to even notice that I was there. 

Once Marlene arrived, we stopped by [Pinocchio’s](http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/food_drink/cheap/documents/02157963.htm) on Winthrop and JFK, a little pizza and sub shop I had never noticed before. My two slices were top-notch, and I’m sure I’ll be back next time I need something quick, cheap, and tasty.
