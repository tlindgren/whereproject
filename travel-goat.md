[Bob](http://bobgoodman.net/) stopped into Cafenation this morning while I was there and while were chatting he mentioned a new site he's been asked to do some consulting work for--[Travel Goat](http://www.travelgoat.com): 

> <span class="style2">&quot;TravelGoat.com </span> is a free customizable insider's audio guide to **New York City **. Unlike other audio walking tours or online travel guides, TravelGoat provides a unique perspective on New York through the power of personal storytelling. The site provides a forum for members of the TravelGoat community to: 
> 
> &bull;&nbsp; **Browse ** your and other's stories
> 
> &bull;&nbsp; Listen to stories online or download them to an MP3 player to **listen ** to at the location the story is about 
> 
> &bull;&nbsp; Use the online recording studio to **record ** and share your own stories 
> 
> &bull;&nbsp; Learn about **locations ** around New York and what your peers think is cool and interesting about them 
> &bull;&nbsp; Create customized walking **tours ** of New York City&quot;    

Not only can you easily record a story right in the browswer and then attach it to a map, but you can also create customized walking tours (&quot;safaris&quot;) that you can dowload as mp3s to your portable music player. While Travelgoat is only designed for NY right now, Bob said they hope to expand to other cities soon.
