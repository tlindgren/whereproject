[![Sanders Theater](/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=215&amp;g2_serialNumber=2 "Sanders Theater")](/gallery/v/SandersTheater/)Friday night we took in a free performance of Carmina Burana Harvard&#039;s [Sanders theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanders_Theater). Our friend Arnie was in the chorus, so it was a good chance to hear him sing and experience this great piece live for the first time. The performance was outstanding, and I can think of few better places to hear a concert like this.

Being there reminded me that one of the first things I did on my first day in Boston was to hear a concert at Sanders Theater.
