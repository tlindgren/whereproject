I&#039;ve been working on the preface to my dissertation this morning, a kind of personal narrative of how I got interested in place blogging and where I&#039;ve ended up now as I finish up. I began wondering if the rise of Facebook has affected the blogging practices of those I&#039;ve been following in my projec, so I posed the question to place bloggers who are also Facebook friends:  
> Hi Alison, Fred, Maria, and Lorianne, 
> 
> I&#039;m working on the final revisions of my dissertation and in my preface I&#039;m reflecting on how I got interested in placeblogging and where I&#039;ve ended up now. Since Facebook has emerged as a significant shift in social media since the time the early days of place blogging, I thought I would invite all my Ecotone Facebook friends to reflect on the relationship between Facebook and your blogging practice. 
> 
> Here are some questions that I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on, should you be so inclined to reflect: 
> 
> -- Do you feel like your Facebook activity is a response to the same impulses/needs/interests that got you into blogging? 
> 
> -- Do you think that these tools have affected what you&#039;re doing when you blog? Are you doing things in Facebook that you might have done in your blog in the past? 
> 
> -- What about the role of microblogging tools like Twitter or Facebook status? 
> 
> -- How would you compare the social network of Facebook and the network associated with your blogging? 
> 
> -- How does Facebook affect your personal attention economy, how you allocate your limit resources of attention toward blogging or other parts of your life? 
> 
> Thanks for any thoughts you might be interested in throwing out--that is, if you can find any time between blogging, FB, Twitter..... :)
