 Some evenings when I walk up the steps to our house, I can see Dave sitting at his easel painting, his figure framed by the window and lit by his nearby lamp. He's a portait painter, and the&nbsp; faces he creates fill our dinning room with color and life.

A couple months ago, I purchased my first piece of art, a piece called &quot;Thistlefield&quot; by Grant Hanna, a talented young student of my friend Tim. Once I find a suitable frame, it will hang in my room near the door, and I look forward to having it in my personal space, causing me to stop and admire it's intricate detail and vibrant colors.
