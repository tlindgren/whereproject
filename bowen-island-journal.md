Bowen Island is 20 square mile chunk of rock lying two miles off the west coast of Canada. It is home to 3000 people, three mountains, two valleys, four lakes, about 15 beaches, two species of salmon, one
village and me and my family. The Squamish name is Xwlil Xhwm. It means &quot;fast drumming ground.&quot; It's about deer.
