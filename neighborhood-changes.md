In my neighborhood of Boston, it seems like every time I walk out the door I notice another store or restaurant that either has disappeared or just come into existence. This evening I took a leisurely stroll to International Bicycle to pick up a new tube, and during my meandering walk (all with in five minutes of my house) I was amazed at how many changes I noticed when I actually paid attention. 

Three stores on Harvard Ave were empty:

*   Sovereign Bank (relocated)

*   Flyrabbit (becoming Regeneration Records)
*   International Pizza and SubsThree stores were new that I hadn't notice before: 

*   Padria Basil Bakery on Harvard Ave

*   Bella Fashion (purses) on Brighton Ave

*   S and I To Go on Brighton (Thai take-out)I also took a closer look at three places that have opened up in the last month or two: 

*   Mt. Mongolian BBQ on Harvard

*   Aneka Rasa Malaysian Restaurant

*   Green Field Brazilian BBQ on Brighton Ave. (formerly the Amvet’s Thrift Store)Compiling this brief inventory  reminds me how little I really know about this neighborhood and how much more of my attention it deserves.
