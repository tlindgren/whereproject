Today I'm geeking out with my fellow Wordpress fans here at [Wordcamp Boston](http://wordcampboston.com/), host byÂ Microsoft's NERD Center (New England Research and Development) on the MIT campus. Now that I've moved my blog to Wordpress and have used it for several other projects, I'm glad to have a chance to get more acquainted with this great open source community.

Here's the view of Boston and the Charles River from our 14th floor room:
