This evening after work I stopped by [Community Servings](http://www.servings.org/) here in JP to pick up my first CSA delivery of fruits and veggies straight from [Heaven's Harvest Farm](http://www.heavensharvestfarm.com/) in [New Braintree, MA](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=new+braintree,+ma&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr). It's the first time I've tried community supported agriculture, so after reading [Michael Polland](http://www.michaelpollan.com/omnivore.php) and [Bill McKibben](http://www.billmckibben.com/deep-economy.html) recently, I'm excited to try out a new relationship to my food.

Here's what I got in this delivery (as closely as I can identify):

redcor kale
green kale
collard greens
strawberrys
romane lettuce
a lemony mint plant
zuccini
cilantro

If anyone has relevant recipes, please don't hesitate to send them my way.
