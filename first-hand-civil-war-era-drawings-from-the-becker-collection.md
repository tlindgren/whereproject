This weekend we attended the opening of the_ [First Hand](http://www.firsthandexhibit.org)_ exhibit, a remarkable collection of Civil War Era sketches never seen by the public before. This exhibit is special for me because I've been managing the website development for both the [Becker Collection](http://www.bc.edu/becker) and the _[First Hand](http://www.firsthandexhibit.org)_ exhibit site over that last three years.

Though I've been looking at the digital versions of these pieces for quite some time, I was a revelation to see the physical items in person.

If you live in the Boston area, it would be well worth your while to stop by to check it out (and please get in touch with me if you do--I'll try to meet up with you).
