<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">(Today I dusted off this essay--it's about four years old now--and decided it would make a good addition to the 'hometown' section of this site.)</span></font>**<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;"></span></font>**<p /><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;text-align:center;" align="center">**<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;">On Being From </span></font>**_<span style="font-style:italic;">**<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font>**</span>_**<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;"></span></font>**<p /><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Where are you from?</span></font>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">

When this question arose at a party recently, it marked a familiar turn in conversation, the moment when I shift from new acquaintance to momentary novelty. “</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North Dakota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">,” I answered, and when her eyes widened, I added, “</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">.” “Oh my God,” she responded, looking up and turning away slightly to the left. Facing me again, she slowly said, “Oh . . . my God. No, really? You are from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">.” A little taken aback by her enthusiasm, all I could muster was, “Yep, </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">.” </span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">When she motioned to a friend and exclaimed, “He’s from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">,” I realized something I probably had known unconsciously for quite some time. Most of my life I had been from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North Dakota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">. Now, however, this new acquaintance made it clear that I was from </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">–the Coen brothers’ film–and I would just have to get used to it.</span></font>

<p>****_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Fargo</span></font>_********_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">, </span></font>_********_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">North Dakota</span></font>_******_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;"></span></font>_**

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Since leaving home to attend college in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Chicago</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, I have been having conversations about where I am from. For a long time, they usually took a similar form: “Where are you from?”– “</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North Dakota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">.” – “Really? I think you’re the first person I’ve met who’s from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North Dakota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">.” Before the 1996 Coen brothers’ film, saying “North Dakota” meant I could look in my interlocutor’s eyes and find a blank space on their mental maps just above South Dakota and below Canada, a tabula rasa of ignorance as pure white as the winter fields I encountered anew last time home. </span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">As I drove on county highways north of </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, blowing snow blended the horizon into the clouds, erasing any sign of boundary to the white expanse of fields. In front of me snow flowed across the road, at one moment a stream of smoky white and the next moment a flock of wisps that tore and regrouped in flight, as if someone left their smoke machine in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Montana</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> and a momentous wind was blowing it low across the plains. I passed a massive pile of decaying sugar beets with steam rolling off it in thick billows that faded just as they reached the road. This pervasive whiteness became the canvas for a late afternoon sundog, a winter rainbow made by airborne ice crystals that formed a nearly complete circle, except where its bottom edge dipped just below the horizon.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2
"><span style="font-size:10pt;">A white blankness of the mind appeared each time someone ventured to me, “</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North Dakota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, isn’t that where </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Mount Rushmore</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> is?” It was a friendly form of ignorance that I usually found empowering. By the time I gently let them know, “No, that’s South Dakota,” they had already commissioned me their myth-maker, letting me shatter their misconceptions if they had them or, if they did not, create a fresh portrait of Fargo they could call their own. Show me someone from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Malibu</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> or </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Manhattan</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, and I will show you a clean canvas prepared for the brush.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">It was always difficult for my new myths not to start off sounding flat. Difficult because </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> lies in one of the flattest spots in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North America</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, in what was 9,000 years ago the bottom of a glacial lake. To grow up in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> is to see the world lying down, a horizontal life with no overlooks and all sky, with no vistas but the </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Twelfth Street</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> overpass or the bird’s-eye view when flying into </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Hector</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">International</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Airport</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">. Our only mountains were the thunderheads rolling in over the plains that I watched when working out in the fields, the dark gray </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Rockies</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> that we could watch until the gust-front winds blew the first drops ahead and sent us running for the pickup.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Living in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> is to learn to walk backwards. Someone once said that in the Chinese view of time we back into the future, facing our past as we move into the unknown of what is to come. I often backed my way through the winters of my childhood, trudging with my front side shielded from the certainty of the North wind. In places where winters are rainy and wet, the cold will seep into your bones as you stand waiting for the train. But in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, when it is 15 below with a brisk wind, the cold crashes in around you within seconds of walking out doors and drenches you within a minute. As you crunch and creak across the partially shoveled sidewalks, bodily fluids begin changing state–hair and eyelashes getting crispy, snot beginning to congeal. But this only true of some days, and of only one season, and if you learn to walk backwards, keeping warm means you forget less quickly where you have been.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">So </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> is flat and cold. The unspoken question that I often face is “Why does anyone live there?” Believe it or not, I will often answer, </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> was once rated the most desirable city in the nation, based on factors like cost of living, pollution, education, unemployment, crime rate. Somehow the poll politely evaded the issue of the weather, but there is no doubt for me that </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> was a fine place to grow up for all the reasons the ratings noticed. It is safe and clean, the schools are good, and the people are friendly. It is a college town with twenty-five thousand students and a lively economy, and the weather is nothing you cannot get used to.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">And if these prosaic virtues fail to impress, I might add that if N.D. became its own state, it would be the third most powerful country in the world because of all the nuclear missiles housed there. I have never actually bothered to substantiate this, but as a kid I saw enough fenced-in missile silos driving out to summer camp every August to be convinced. Being from the biggest city of the third most powerful country in the world should probably give me more cause for reflection, but until secession happens, I suppose I’ll attend to my less hypothetical questions of identity.</span></font>

<p>****_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Have you seen the movie?</span></font>_******_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;"></span></font>_**

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">There was a time when talking about where I was from gave me opportunity to act as advocate for my hometown, to save it from the East Coast cultured despisers or the West Coast cosmopolitans. However, after 1996 that blank gaze of ignorance I once relished became a look glazed over by a thick film called </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">. For more than three years after the movie hit the box office, I never could give a convincing answer for why I had failed to see the movie. I usually muttered something about not liking violent movies. In reality, however, I was stubbornly unwilling to admit that I had a rival in representing where I’m from. I had become comfortable having license to create people’s myth of </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, and now there was a movie out that usurped that role, that caricatured the natives of </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> and </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">North Dakota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, and did so under the title of my hometown. I have never been much of a movie critic, but since the movie </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> came out, talking about where I am from has become a movie review.</span></font>

<p>****_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">So what did you think?</span></font>_******_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;"></span></font>_**

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Now that I’ve seen the film, I’m willing to admit that I like it, though I always hope conversations will last long enough for me to voice a few modest criticisms. As one Washington Post reviewer (originally from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">) put it, the problems with </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> can be stated simply: too much violence, too much accent, too little </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">. Did we really need blood to spurt from a patrolman’s head after being shot, or to have Carl Showalter put in a wood chipper? Did we really need to hear “Ya” that many times? Did they really need to call the movie </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> if all but five minutes of the movie takes place in Brainerd and </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minneapolis</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">? The Coens grew up in this part of the country (</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minneapolis</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">) so I refuse to accept their quirky sense of artistic license as an excuse in this case, particularly since their attempt to represent their hometown impinges on my own effort to figure out what it means to be from there.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">The danger for the Coen brothers, like anyone who has moved away to one power center or another, is that in representing their hometown they too often land at one of two extremes–idealization or disparagement. We usually idealize when we stand to benefit from associating ourselves with something that, in hindsight, appears superior to where we now live. We malign our hometown when we have more to gain by severing any associations with what seems to be a provincial, benighted past. Avoiding either extreme is the more difficult task.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">As Wes Jackson once put it, “Any fool can appreciate </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">California</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">; it takes real character to appreciate </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Kansas</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">.” If I fault the Coen brothers for anything in </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, it is not precisely for lack of character, but for a loss of nerve, not for making an unconventional movie about ordinary people in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, but for those moments when they slipped into rather conventional mode of disparagement. Violence has become standard for Coen films, and in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> it became disappointingly easy way to deal with might seem like an unremarkable setting. When faced with a stark white landscape populated by boring and simpleminded northerners, they could not resist the urge to splatter it with blood. Moreover, the caricatures of the </span></font><font face="Trebuch

et MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> accent at moments sound like the graceless humor of someone who has been away too long, one who knows enough to do hilarious impersonations of Minnesotans at </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">New York</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> parties but has lost the ability to sustain nuanced humor through an entire movie. Minnesotans do not mind being made fun of–Garrison Keillor does it every Saturday night–but they have a right to expect that someone from </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> will avoid letting good-natured ribbing slip into body checking.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Watching </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, I can never shake the sense of being used. Only the first short scene takes place in what is supposed to be a dingy </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> bar, but none of the movie was actually filmed in there, and the rest of it takes place in Brainerd and </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minneapolis</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">. The Coen brothers are the first to admit they used </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> for the name because they knew a movie called _<span style="font-style:italic;">Brainerd</span>_ would have little hope of success at the box office. What they may not admit is that using Fargo for a movie set in Brainerd is a subtle form of exploitation based on the assumption that says, “It’s all the same up there anyway–cold expanses of snow populated by simple-minded Swedes who say ‘Ya, you betcha’ and talk about the weather.” Their use of </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> reveals they have more to gain from disparaging their hometown than appreciating it, more to gain from artistic bravado than from complex and risky understatement.</span></font>

<p>****_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">I liked it</span></font>_******_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;"></span></font>_**

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Despite my frustrations with the film, I have developed a fondness for it by learning to adopt a Marge-centric perspective. I refer, of course, to Marge Gunderson, the pregnant policewomen from Brainerd who investigates the increasingly violent consequences of Jerry Lundegaard’s inept machinations. Margie is intelligent, acutely observant, and shrewdly witty. She is tough-minded in doing her job but also deeply compassionate in a brilliantly understated </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> way. She deals with crime when it comes her way, but her robust affirmation of the everyday makes it clear that the “malfeasance” she investigates in no way defines her life.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">I think that the film is really about Marge and that she not only is the redemptive element in an otherwise bleak story, but she also compensates for the Coen brothers' loss of imaginative nerve in other aspects of the film. The excessive violence may have seemed an artistic risk, but it was not nearly as risky as having a heroine more brilliantly and triumphantly ordinary than most of us were prepared to appreciate. </span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">I like to imagine that Marge occasionally appears in the Coen brothers' dreams, the voice of their repressed consciences, making them regret for just a moment that in representing where they were from, they may have overdone a few things: “So I hear ya made a movie about a string of murders up there in </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> then. Even put a guy in a wood chipper. Ya, that sure was different. Well I suppose when you’ve lived out East a while ya gotta throw a guy in wood chipper once in while to make the old home country seem a little more interesting. (Pause) Well, there’s more ta making movies than being violent and ironic, ya know. (Pause) Don’t ya know that?” </span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">In the end, I would like to believe that at some level the Coen brothers, like me, were trying to answer the question, Where are you from? If Marge was their best attempt to represent their hometown, to tread a middle path between idealization and disparagement, I would say they did a pretty good job.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">I have to admit I am still a bit sore that the movie broke up a perfectly good monopoly on representation, making my job of portraying </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> a bit more challenging than it was before. But I suppose a little competition never hurts. If the movie does not literally represent where I am from, I am now more willing to admit not that the pictures I draw of </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> also bear the marks of my own idiosyncrasies and shortcomings. While it is true that I am from the geographical place called </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span>, a place with a particular landscape and a particular culture that has shaped me, it is also true that now I no longer live there, and I am shaped as much by the story I am writing about _<span style="font-style:italic;">being from</span>_ </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> as by physically being there. If answering the question where I am from has made me a movie critic, it also has made me more conscious of the myths I have created since leaving home.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">“A lot can happen in the middle of nowhere” is the advertising catchphrase on the rental box for </span></font>_<span style="font-style:italic;"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Fargo</span></font></span>_<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">, which tells us that the Coen brothers have made an excellent movie out of a setting where normally nothing of importance takes place. Or put more pointedly, it suggests that </span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">Minnesota</span></font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;"> is not such a characterless hinterland when you drag a string of murders through it and finally cram someone in a wood chipper in the end.</span></font>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><span style="font-size:10pt;">But the more I try to talk about where I am from, the more I have to believe that in fact quite a lot happened in Fargo before the movie came out, if for no other reason than because I grew up there and my family still lives there. And if it ever becomes “the middle of nowhere” in my imagination and in the stories I tell of it, if I ever become content either to malign or idealize it, then leaving there–being from there–has done me little good.</span></font>
