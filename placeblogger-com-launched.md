Yesterday [Numenius](http://www.magpienest.org/feathersofhope/) gave me the heads up the Lisa Williams went live with her directory of place blogs at [placeblogger.com](http://www.placeblogger.com). Congratulations, Lisa!

It&#039;s  quite an accomplishment to pull something like this together, an effort I appreciate because I attempted something similar earlier this summer and gave up once I remembered that I hadn&#039;t finished my dissertation (funny how that slips my mind sometimes). What I find interesting is that Lisa and I  were developing place blogging directories using Drupal at the same time while living a few miles apart in the Boston area but without having met each other. By July I had developed and abandoned my revised Ecotone site at placeblogging.com and by early August Lisa had bet a colleague that she could collect 1000 place blogs from around the country. I don&#039;t know if she&#039;s reached the 1000 mark yet or not, but she must be close, and placeblogger.com promises to be a useful showcase for this genre of blogging.

Lisa&#039;s [definition of place blogs](http://www.placeblogger.com/faq) is a useful one: 
 > A placeblog is an act of sustained attention to a particular place over time
>      It can be done by one person, a defined group of people, or in a way that’s open to community contribution
>      It’s not a newspaper, though it may contain random acts of journalism
>      It’s about the lived experience of a place 

Lisa has spoken a couple of times at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard, and you can listen to her discuss the project by visiting the [Berkman archives](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mediaberkman/tag/people/lisa-williams/).
