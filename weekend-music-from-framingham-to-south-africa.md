After hearing two outstanding concerts this weekend, I&#039;m struck by how long it takes me get around to finding good music sometimes. Sunday night I made my first trip to Framingham to hear John Gorka play ([Dan Coutier](http://www.dancloutier.homestead.com/) opening - nice job Dan), which gave me the chance to get better aqcuainted with someone I knew from his great cover of Dylan&#039;s &quot;Girl From the North Country&quot; on the _Nod to Bob_ album. On Sunday night we heard the [Mystic Chorale](http://www.mysticchorale.org/) peform a concert of South African music in the historic Tremont Temple in downtown Boston, which got me back in touch with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whom I knew from Paul Simon&#039;s _Graceland_. 

And how is it that I&#039;ve lived without Miriam Makebe&#039;s “Pata Pata” to get me going on a Monday morning. It now has a permanent place in my “Happy, Funky, Soul” playlist.

It&#039;s nice to know there are some new things under the sun--at least new to me--if I take time to come out from under my rock once in a while.
