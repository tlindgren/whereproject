I&#039;m excited to be participating in the 21st Annual Bikes Not Bombs (BNB) Bike-A-Thon on June 8th, riding 62 miles to raise money for this fine organization that promotes biking for transportation and community development.

**ABOUT BIKES NOT BOMBS**
BNB is doing many things right: recycling donated bikes, training city kids to repair bikes, sending bikes to developing countries and fighting to make the city more bike-friendly. What&#039;s more, BNB has become the local bike shop that go to when I need repairs. 

Biking may not be the answer to all the worlds problems, but it is an increasingly important lifestyle choice that allows many of us to get where we need to go and to contribute to the health of our communities and the environment. 

**HOW YOU CAN HELP**
I&#039;m looking for people to contributing to BNB&#039;s work by supporting my ride. If you&#039;re able to contribute something, I would really appreciate it. 

You can donate securely online at: http://www.firstgiving.com/tim-lindgren

Or, if you are local and want to drop it off at my house, or don&#039;t mind mailing it, your gift will go farther as a check or cash (BNB pays a 7.35% processing fee for each online donation). Please make the check out to &quot;Bikes Not Bombs&quot;, put &quot;Tim Lindgren BAT08&quot; in the memo line, and mail it to me at the address below (or put in my mailbox).  Please send me an email to let me know if you are making a donation this way so I can record it properly. 

**Please make your donations before June 1st.  
**
If you are interested in joining me on the ride (the more the merrier!), there are several distances to choose from: 15, 25, and 62 miles.  You can also come by and enjoy the Green Roots Festival!  See the Bikes Not Bombs website for more info about the organization and the events on June 8th:

Please forward this email to others whom you think would be interested in supporting Bikes Not Bombs.

Thanks for your support!
