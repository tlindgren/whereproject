My dad sent me these pictures he took a couple weeks ago at the edge of the Red River in Fargo. This "ice artistry" was sculpted by freezing temperatures at the waters crest and and then carefully installed in a gallery of trees as the water slowly receded. Wish I could have been there while the show was up.
