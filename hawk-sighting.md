This evening I hadn't been in Mt. Auburn for more than five minutes when I looked up to see this hawk perched on a lowing-hanging branch of an Oak tree. For the next fifteen minutes, I watched it sit stoicly while a blue-jay harrassed it, charging down ever few minutes to glance of the hawk's head.

My best guess it was a red-tailed hawk.
