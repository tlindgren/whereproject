This past week I  finished developing a site called [Past
    Shapes, Present Stories: A Critical Guide to Boston-Area Memorials](http://www2.bc.edu/%7Edodman/memorialproject/) for
    a friend and colleague of mine at BC who has been teaching
    the American Literary History III survey this semester. As a final project
    assignment, Trevor had his students research local memorials and produce
    critical readings of them, which has resulted  in this online collection
    of downloadable guides. 

To design the site, I integrated a Flash mapping application called
  Map Bureau ([www.mapbureau.com](http://www.mapbureau.com/)) with
  a a simple PHP/MySQL interface so that Trevor could help enter his students
  project descriptions. This marks my first real foray into online mapping, and
  now I'm anxious to begin exploring ways to geocode blog entries using some
  of the location-based Drupal modules currently under development.
