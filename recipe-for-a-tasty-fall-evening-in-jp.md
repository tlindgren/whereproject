Last night we had friends over to JP for the Lantern Parade around Jamaica Pond ([a few pictures here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/donayer/sets/72157594351260092/with/283198644/)), a community event featuring lanterns made by kids in the neighborhood to raise money for charity. It was blustery and cold, but it didn't keep the faithful away, and as usual there was no shortage of super-cute costumed kids.

After our stroll around the pond, we walked back to the apartment for an autumn-themed dinner:

*   Carrot Ginger Soup, served in baby pumpkin bowls
*   [Butternut Squash Pizza with Rosemary](/%20Butternut%20Squash%20Pizzas%20with%20Rosemary)
*   Pumpkin Cheesecake from Trader Joes, with baked pumpkin seeds on top
*   Hot Mulled cider
*   Red wine
The pizza was particularly tasty, so I would recommend trying it if you're looking for a twist on the standard fall fare.

We bought the pumpkins a couple of weeks ago at the [Allendale Farm](http://www.allandalefarm.com/), which is only a couple miles from here just on the other side of the Arnold Arboretum and is the last working farm in Boston/Brookline.
