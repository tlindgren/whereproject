&quot;Why bike to work?&quot; Because you might see something interesting along the way, according to Phillip Barron at [nicomachus.net](http://nicomachus.net). Phillip emailed me with link to this great slideshow of photos he&#039;s taken while biking in the Durham, NC area. I like the way he includes a bike in each image, as if to remind us that the bike not only transportation that gets us around but a vehicle for seeing the world on a daily basis.
