An article in today's Boston Globe (&quot;[All
    over the map: New technology inspires projects that are redefining the artistic
  landscape](http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2005/04/15/all_over_the_map/%20)&quot;) alerted me to several locative events happening as part
  of the [Boston Cyberarts
  Festival 2005](http://bostoncyberarts.org/%20) (April 22 through May 8). The schedule is listed under [GPS
  and Satellite Imagery Programs. ](http://cyberarts.qc1.net/bca/events/event_details_multiple.php?eventids=12,43,58,59,5&amp;title=GPS%20 "GPS%20")

In particular, I hope to take in the [Land/Mark:
Locative Media and Photography](http://www.bu.edu/prc/landmark/index.htm)  at BU and the [FLOATING
POINTS 2: NETWORKED ART IN PUBLIC SPACES](http://institute.emerson.edu/floatingpoints/05/index.php) discussion at Emerson.
