Hank emailed to let me know about a new journal he and some of his colleagues put together this past month. Several of them are graduate students intheÂ  University of Montana environmental writing.

As they describe it, [Wild Thoughts](http://www.wildthoughts.org/) &quot;provides high-quality nature-based art, poetry,
                      photography, fiction, and essays from everywhere, to everyone
                      online. We have opinions, we have talent, and we have a
                      stake in the more-than-human world. We have Wild Thoughts.&quot;
