Of course there's great irony in the fact that just as I'm writing an article on place blogging, I'm spending very little time either blogging or venturing very far beyond the space in front of my computer screen. In my darker moments, I fear that this is just an inherent part of academic work, the necessary divide between theory and practice that has infected scholarship in the humanities. 

This is certainly part of it, but it's also true that I'm just too busy and I can't spread myself any thinner. In time I'll figure out again how to write my dissertation and blog regularly, to walk and chew gum at the same time. 

I will say that I've enjoyed my interviews with [Fred](http://www.fragmentsoffloyd/), [Lorianne](http://www.hoardedordinaries.com/), and [Pica](http://www.magpienest.org/feathersofhope/) over the last month or so, and as long as <span style="font-style:italic;">they're </span>still blogging, all is still right in the blogosphere. 

For now, I'm just glad I've made it to Cafenation in Brighton Center fairly early. The Christmas music is playing (Elvis as the moment) and I've must got my usual small cup of light roast. It's time to get back to writing <span style="font-style:italic;">about </span>place blogs.
