Thanks to [Numenius](/,%20I%27m%20trying%20to%20not%20take%20offense%20at%20his%20statement,), I ran across the photoblog [Everydot](http://afiler.com/everydot) from my part of the world:  
> **Every dot on the map** interests me, especially the little tiny ones. Some “towns” are no more than an intersection, possibly with a store or a town hall. A few towns seem to be gone without a trace, though sometimes the tiniest evidence remains. I have photographed over 300 towns, mostly in Minnesota and North Dakota. I also have photographed a number of towns in Manitoba, Ontario, and Washington, as well as a couple in Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Iowa.

His attention to &quot;every dot&quot; counters the tendency of maps to impose an abstract system of valuation on places, a system in which big dots gather power and attention at the expense of little dots. While his statement &quot;I’d like to finish North Dakota first, as it seems the easiest to conquer&quot; seems to run counter to the more egalitarian premise of his project, I&#039;m trying to not take offense as a North Dakota native. I suppose its just a matter of quantity in this case, not quality.
