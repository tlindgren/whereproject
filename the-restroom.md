Nancy M. alerted me to this unique blog, [The Restroom: A journal of design oddities in public restrooms](http://therestroom.blogspot.com/) featured today in [a Boston Herald article](http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=97220). In my mind, it has the charactersitcs of a fine place blog, combining the observation of places over time, close attention to ordinary experience, a concern for the implication of design choices on our lives. And it's a local Boston blog to boot.
