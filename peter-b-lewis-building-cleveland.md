![Peter B. Lewis Building](/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=202&amp;g2_serialNumber=2 "Peter B. Lewis Building")I've spent most of my day today in the                    Peter B. Lewis Building, a Frank Gehry building which houses part of the Wheatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH). I'm here for the [New Media Consortium Conference](http://www.nmc.org/events/2006summerconf/index.shtml), and I've taking advantage of the wireless connection to finish my [presentation](http://www.bcteach.org/presentations/drupal/). But over lunch I got outside to snap some photos of the building, a nice addition my growing collection of Gehry pictures&nbsp; (L.A. Philharmonic building, [MIT Stata Center](/drupal-4.7/node/233)).
