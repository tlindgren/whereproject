[![](http://www.whereproject.org/wp-content/uploads/DSC00728-300x225.jpg "DSC00728")](http://whereproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/dsc00728.jpg)Yesterday we took a pleasant bike ride around the Eastern Point area of Gloucester, a peninsula that sticks out into Gloucester Harbor. I've driven around the loop any times, but it was only as we began exploring some of the side roads that we discovered entire areas that we didn't realize existed. Following one such road took us back among the summer houses of the absurdly rich, one of which was the [Beauport](http://www.historicnewengland.org/visit/homes/beauport.htm), former home of <span class="plain">interior designer Henry Davis Sleeper. Eventually we ended up at the Eastern Point Lighthouse and the Gloucester Tidebreak</span>. Walking out to the end afforded us fine views of both the lighthouse and downtown Gloucester.

On our way home we swung through the [Rocky Neck Art Colony](http://www.rockyneckartcolony.org/), which the oldest active art colony in the country. Unfortunately, most of the galleries were closed for the day, and most everything else seemed to closed for the season.
