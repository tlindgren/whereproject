This morning I read in the Boston Globe about Google's decision to allow developers to plug customized data into Google maps, basically legitizing what hackers were already doing (&quot;[Google points way to Maps' code&quot;)](http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/06/30/google_points_way_to_maps_code). They've made their API info available at [http://www.google.com/apis/](http://www.google.com/apis/)

When I ran across the [GeoProject USA](http://www.geoprojectusa.com/confluence/map/dist/), I noticed they had already put together their own [Google map](http://www.geoprojectusa.com/confluence/map/dist/) to present geocoded information. The project is an another interesting heuristic for exploring place: 

 > The objective of Geo Project USA is to visit and photograph every spot in the U.S. where a whole-numbered  					[minute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc) of  					[latitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latitude) intersects with a whole-numbered  					[minute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc) of  					[longitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longitude) (e.g.,  					[ 					38&deg;14'00&quot;N, 109&deg;55'00&quot;W](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=road+runner+country+utah&amp;ll=38.233333,-109.916666&amp;spn=0.009184,0.008122&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en)), in what is better known as a  					[confluence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence) point.&nbsp;
