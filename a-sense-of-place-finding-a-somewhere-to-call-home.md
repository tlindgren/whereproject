Yesterday I tried out Google's new [blogsearch](http://blogsearch.google.com) feature by plugging in &quot;place&quot; and one of the first sites that came up was Ronni Bennett's blog, &quot;[A Sense of Place: Finding a Place to Call Home](http://www.asenseofplace.net/).&quot; In May she decided to start this blog to document her recent decision to leave New York City after 30-some years and to find a less expensive part of the country to live in. Ronni has been keeping another blog for a while now, [Time Goes By: What It's Really Like to Get Older](http://www.timegoesby.net); the new blog builds on this one by focusing on what it's like to have to move later in life after having been somewhere for so long. There's a particular energy that comes with a new blog, especially when it's clear some important personal work is getting done in the writing. I looking forward to reading about her transition to Portland, ME, a place that I have [good memories of visiting](/drupal-4.7/node/145).

It was nice to cross paths in the comments with some other familiar faces--[Fred](http://www.fragmentsfromfloyd.com/) and [Rana](http://www.ranablog.com/). It's no wonder they would find common ground with Ronni's blogging.
