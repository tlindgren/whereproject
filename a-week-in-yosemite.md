<span class="inline left"> </span>We'll, this is fairly late in coming, but I guess I should post something about our trip to Yosemite a week ago. I think I've been avoiding this post because it's so hard to know what to say about such a fantastic place. Perhaps I'll just let the photos speak for themselves, though they don't really do justice either.

I will say that we were lucky to be there when we were--the weather was good, the crowds were relatively thin, and the waterfalls were at peak. We had a nice mix of activities--a stay in the Wawona Hotel, a visit to the giant sequoias, three nights car camping in Yosemie Valley, three days backpacking out of the Valley, one afternoon horseback riding, and a bit of time on either end in San Francisco.

Perhaps I'll have more to say as I get further from it, but for now here are some photos to give you a taste of how we experience this incomparable place.
