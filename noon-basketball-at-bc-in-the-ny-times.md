Jeanne sent me a link to this article in the NY Times that references the noon basketball pick-up games I take part in regularly at Boston College:

> CHESTNUT HILL, Mass., Jan. 20 - Around noon nearly every weekday,
> Boston College Coach Al Skinner rolls into an auxiliary gym at Conte
> Forum wearing gray jogging pants with maroon mesh shorts pulled over
> them. 
> 
> He will bang in the low post with history professors and
> take associate athletic directors off the dribble; his afternoon ritual
> is one he observes zealously. Skinner is still known, at age 52, to
> swing his elbows a bit and make the occasional phantom foul call come
> crunch time.
> 
> &quot;It's kind of hilarious,&quot; Boston College guard Louis Hinnant said, &quot;but he's old school.&quot;

I was a little disappointed that they didn't mention the graduate student who sits outside and shoots little jumpers when everyone else collapses in on Coach. However, like his players, I can testify that that doesn't yell at me when I miss my many15-footers.

Go Eagles.
