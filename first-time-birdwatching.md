This morning I got up early for my first day of birdwatching. At just before 7:00, I made my way to Mt. Auburn cemetery to join a tour with Wayne the Audubon Society
orthnothologist.

I photographed this green heron this past Sunday as I was taking my weekly morning stroll at Mt. Auburn. Some birders were nearby that day to tell me what it was.
