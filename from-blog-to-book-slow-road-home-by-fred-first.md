This morning I ordered a copy of [Fred's](http://www.fragmentsfromfloyd.com/) new book [A Slow Road Home](http://goosecreekpress.pbwiki.com/FrontPage), a project that grew out of his blog entries over the last few years. I've been following Fred's blog for the last two years as part of them dissertation research and have chatted with him several times about his writing, so it's great to see him reach this latest milestone. I not only look forward to reading his book but also to continuing to follow his&nbsp; blogging in _Fragments of Floyd.&nbsp;_  

Congratulations, Fred!&nbsp;
