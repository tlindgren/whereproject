This morning I went with my housemate, Monica, and her parents to Sorella's in Jamaica Plain, and I was glad to discover a spot to add to my list of good Boston breakfast joints. What's remarkable about this small restaurant on Centre street is the shear amount of reading it takes to sort through your options. The menu can't contain the list of inventive omlettes, pancakes, waffles, and french toast; the choices spill out into the restaurant itself, onto the hand-written descriptions plastered on every spare inch of wall space. 

Once I realized I could never take in all the options if I ever hoped to eat that day, I was able to settle on the mango-banana-walnut pancake combo meal, which was quite satifying. The homefries could have been better, but everything else was top notch. I look forward to a Sorella's-Arnold Arboritum combination some Saturday this summer.
