Yesterday afternoon Ben and I biked up to Gloucester where we joined other friends to take in the annual [Greasy Pole Competition](http://www.stpetersfiesta.org/gpmain.htm) (read more for [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greasy_Pole)). Despite the forecast of thunderstorms, we enjoyed a very pleasant weather for our ride and even after missing our turn in Manchester by the Sea, we still managed to get there in time to watch a good part of the competition. 

Here&#039;s a one-minute recap of yesterday&#039;s event:
