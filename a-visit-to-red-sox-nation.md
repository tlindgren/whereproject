Joel, Monica, and I took in a Red Sox game against the Orioles tonight, a losing effort for the Sox but a nice evening in Fenway for us nonetheless. Since I find baseball a bit slow, I entertained myself by focusing on other sources of action, such as drunk fans getting thrown out by security and peanut vendors, like the one in this photo, chucking their wares with impressive skill.
