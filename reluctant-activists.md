Yesterday afternoon, Jonathan, Marlene, Steve and I spend the day ringing doorbells in Plainstow, NH, trying to put in a good word for John Kerry. I think most of us were reluctant activists going into this venture, but by the end of the day we were glad to have done our part. I, for one, enjoy neither politics nor canvassing and I'm not happy about the choices we've been given in this election. However, I feel strongly enough that we need a different president that I decided (with the prodding of Bob Massie) that I should try to participate in the democratic process (however flawed) by spending the day in NH (since my vote doesn't count for much in MA).
