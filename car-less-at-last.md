It's symbolic that the day after I got my new bike from Bikes Not Bombs, I was also able to get rid of my car--sometime yesterday the LaBaron was donated to a worthy cause. I really don't need a car in the city, and I certainly can live with out all the repairs that car would have needed, given it's age. Now I should be able to get by just fine between Zipcar and Cathy's Jeep, and the rest of the time I'll enjoy gliding around town on my hot red Bianchi.
