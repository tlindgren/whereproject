 Description: 
 PastPlaces is a free major global resource for finding or listing information, memories, stories, images, video of past places, past times, properties, houses, homes, friends, family, ancestors, communities, towns, cities, old houses, streets, history and events. Pastplaces.com is a structured database which consists of listings added by members and the website owner. Listings are under several different categories. Members can enter in their own words, a detailed summary of the information that they have available or would like to obtain. You can add places from anywhere in the world. Listings can be an area in general or you might want something specific; such as a video of the route you used to walk to school. You might want to find information about a holiday destination, old pubs or clubs you used to frequent, or you might be an expatriate who is living on the other side of the world and would like someone to video places from your youth. PastPlaces also allows you to list places of employment, education, military service, entertainment and worship. You can also list historic events or family events.
