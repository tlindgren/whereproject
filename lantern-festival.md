This evening I attended my first Lantern Festival at [Forest Hills Cemetery](http://www.foresthillstrust.org/) in Jamaica Plain. Marlene and I had "hope" written on our lamp in Chinese calligraphy. At about 8:30, we launched it into the pond with hundreds of other lamps and then watched as they drifted in mysterious, constantly-changing formations throughout the rest of the evening.
