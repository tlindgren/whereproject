&quot;This is an atlas of maps and graphic representations of the geographies

              of the new electronic territories of the Internet, the World-Wide

              Web and other emerging Cyberspaces.

These maps of Cyberspaces - _cybermaps_
- help us visualise and comprehend the new digital landscapes beyond
our computer screen, in the wires of the global communications networks
and vast online information resources. The cybermaps, like maps of the
real-world, help us navigate the new information landscapes, as well
being objects of aesthetic interest. They have been created by
'cyber-explorers' of many different disciplines, and from all corners
of the world.&quot;
