Our noon basketball games made it into the news [again](/drupal-4.7/node/203), this time in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

last Saturday: 

> After starring at UMass, Skinner played in the ABA, NBA and overseas from
> 1974-81\. He was a teammate and roommate of Julius Erving on the New York Nets.
> Now 52, Skinner's playing style and competitiveness are still evident in
> the weekday noon pickup games he plays in against assorted BC professors,
> administrators, the stray assistant football coach and gym rats.
> 
> &quot;Al plays like it's the NBA Finals, and he's behind,&quot; said Bill
> Toof, 59, the ex-BC ski coach now handling the football team's game
> analysis operation. &quot;Al doesn't like to lose. One day I told our athletic
> director, 'Hey, when are we going to get a basketball coach? Al can't be a
> basketball coach. He's not a big enough [jerk].' Other [coaches] were full of
> themselves, impressed with themselves. Al is a genuinely nice man who is a
> competitor --- a fierce competitor.&quot;
