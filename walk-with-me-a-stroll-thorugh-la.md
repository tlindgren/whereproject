On May 15th, the artist behind the project [Walk with Me](http://www.walklawithme.com/)  will set from her home in Echo Park on foot with the goal of walking all of LA before she returns. Along the way, she plans to document her explorations with a [vblog](http://walkla.blogs.com/). 

This made me think of my time with Sara and Brian at their new house in Echo Park last summer. Perhaps they'll be able to see Lisa off when she begins her journey.
