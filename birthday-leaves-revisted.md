Last year on my 30th, I wrote about spending the morning at Mt. Auburn Cemetery; this year I revisited [birthday leaves](http://www.whereproject.org/node/view/4) by returning the Consecration Dell to see if the leaves and the water had composed a similar scene. This time around, the pond was less uniformly green, but the leaves still  embedded themselves on its surface to great effect.
