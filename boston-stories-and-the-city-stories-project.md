Today as I made my way through the Ecotone site, I found my way to Derek Powazek's  [The City Stories Project](http://citystories.com/) and subsequently to the [Boston Stories](http://www.bostonstories.org/) site. The Boston site is organized by neighborhood, so I visited the [Allston](http://www.bostonstories.org/allston/index.html) section, only to find no-one had posted anything. An excuse for me to write something, I suppose...

The Cities Stories Project strikes me as similar to the other Derek's-- Derek Owens-- [21st-Century Neighborhoods](http://www.ourmap.org/)<!--break--> project, and may serve as one possible model for how to build a nationwide collection of student writing about place. 

Derek Powazek describes the project this way: 

<div style="margin-left:40px;">**What's the big idea here?**</div>

I have this idea. There is a thing that I call _city-based storytelling_.
It's somewhere in between a personal journal and a city guide. It's a
series of personal stories where the city itself becomes a character in
your story. SF Stories is basically my long love letter to San
Francisco. What city do you love?

**What is The City Stories Project?**

It's a network of city-based storytelling sites, tying real people
in real cities all over the world together with a thread of personal
stories.

**What is city-based storytelling?**

It's halfway between a personal journal and a travel book. It's when
you tell the stories of your life, and the city itself becomes a key
character. It's a long, winding love story to the city you live in.
It's personal, true stories about what it's like to be who you are, and
live where you live.
