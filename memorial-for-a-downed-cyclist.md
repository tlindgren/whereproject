While riding over the I-90 footbridge this weekend, I came across a memorial for Kirsten Malone, a young woman killed on Saturday when she was struck by a car, apparently in the area where the down ramp meets the frontage road--not the safest interchange for bikers. I assume the bike painted white and chained to nearby telephone pole was installed in her honor.
