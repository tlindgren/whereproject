For the next two weeks, I'm up at the [Computers in Writing Intensive Classrooms](http://www.hu.mtu.edu/ciwic/) program at Michigan Tech. We've hit the ground running the last couple of days, and I already feel like I've learned quite a bit. 

In the New Media workshop I'm in, we've been discussing the nature of visual arguments, and our first assignments have had us working in Photoshop and Director, two programs I was larglely unfamiliar with when I started. 

Our first day's assignment was to create a one-page visual argument using photoshop, and the second day's assignment was to create a sequential argument using Director. 

I took &quot;e-waste&quot; as my topic for both: 

*   [Photoshop project](http://www.whereproject.org/files/images/ciwic2005/ewaste-image.jpg)

*   [Director project](http://www.whereproject.org/files/images/ciwic2005/ewaste.dcr) (1 MB)

I'm now off to a picnic along Lake Superior, a much-need break from the lab.
