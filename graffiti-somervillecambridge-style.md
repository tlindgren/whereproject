[![](http://www.whereproject.org/wp-content/uploads/DSCN0491-225x300.jpg "DSCN0491")](http://whereproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/dscn0491.jpg)This afternoon I noticed these two pieces of street art on Summer Street in Somerville, one a spray painted portrait of Nome Chomsky and the other a picture of a mushroom cloud attached to a no parking sign a little way down the street. Someone from the neighborhood has noticed the Chomsky portrait as well, wondering if this might be a form of "[intellectual graffiti](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lombrozo/) " and has commented, "I presume it was motivated by political rather than linguistic reasons,  but it's still the only instance of cognitive science graffiti I've  come across." I agree with her that only in Cambridge would someone think to chose Noam Chomstky as as a graffiti topic, though I did run across a mention of a similar [sighting in Atlanta](http://www.apollopony.net/2006/01/noam_chomsky_ma.html).
