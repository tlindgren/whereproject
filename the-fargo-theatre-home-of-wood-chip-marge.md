This morning I cruised downtown on my dad's old Schwinn to photograph the the [8-foot tall, 500 pound chainsaw statue of Marge Gunderson](http://www.whereproject.org/node/view/154) from the movie _Fargo _which stands on the second floor of the Fargo Theatre. Given [my feelings about the movie](http://www.whereproject.org/node/view/96), I thought this was a fitting way for MGM to honor Fargo after the Coen brothers' hijacked the city's name for their movie.
