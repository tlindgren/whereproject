Some random comments on a post from a couple years ago ([Fargo Theatre Home of &quot;Wood-Chip Marge&quot;)](/drupal-4.7/node/155/) prompts me to post a photo took of my favorite local movie venue, the Coolidge Corner Theatre. On Saturday night, Cathy, Megan, and I strolled over from Allston on a mild spring night to take in &quot;Thank You for Smoking,&quot; and having a new camera to test out gave me a good excuse to snap this photo of the marquee. When I move in September, I'll be doing everything I can to keep some reasonable proximity to Coolidge Corner so that I can continue the habit of walking to and from tthe movies.
