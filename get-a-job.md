Yesterday Cathy and I headed up to Cape Ann to visit Tim and Meg and explore [Dogtown Commons](http://www.oddnewengland.com/state_ma/dogtown/dogtown.htm), the nature preserve that makes up much of the inland area of Gloucester. It has a colorful history stretching back to the early colonists, full of tales of the pirates, witches, and widows who supposedly inhabited it. 

One of our goals was to track down [Babson's Boulders](http://www.capeannweb.com/babsonboulders.htm), a string of large stones with inspirational sayings engraved on them, commissioned by the millionaire philanthropist Roger Babson during the Great Depression. Since I'm applying for a job right now, I was particularly interested in finding the &quot;Get a Job&quot; stone, hoping to tap into its good luck properties. According to the [geocache desciption](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?pf=&amp;guid=b3692bb7-12ac-4686-832b-f1e82b639c90&amp;decrypt=y&amp;log=&amp;numlogs=) we used to locate the rock: 

> Local legend and lore says that if you are seeking employment that you should kiss the large boulder found at these coordinates and pour a fifth of Bourbon on it for better luck on your search. 

Not having any bourbon might hurt my chances a bit, but I still feel good about making the pilgrimage.

We ended the day at [Halibut Point](/drupal-4.7/node/30), hoping to catch some action from Tropical Storm Ophelia, but there wasn't much sign of her. Nonetheless, the views were as great as they alway are. &nbsp;
