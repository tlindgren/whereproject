Last night Cathy, Edward, and I took in a great show by our new friend [Geni](http://www.genimusic.com/home.cfm)  from St. James&#039;s at Ryles in Inman Square. In addition to being an accomplished flutist, Geni distinguishes himself by playing jazz with a [shakuhachi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi), a Japanese bamboo flute, and the shakulute, a traditional flute with a bamboo headpiece. Throughout the evening, he treated us to his own tunes as well as fresh versions of songs by Sting, Theolonious Monk, and Violent Femmes. He also brought up a vocalist for a few Brazilian tunes and his instructor from Berkeley for some tag-team flute virtuosity. Looking forward to your new album, Geni.
