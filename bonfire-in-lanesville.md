I spent this July 4th out in Lanesville, a village of Gloucester on Cape Anne, about an hour drive north of Boston. Around 9:00 we walked down to Lane's cove to watch home-grown fireworks and the largest bonfire I'd ever seen--a pile of wood about 30 feet high with a sailboat perched on top. It was a spectacular sight, and we could all felt like Boston's Esplanade had nothing over us.
