Before the big storm hit, I managed to get up to Cape Anne to see Tim and Meg for a little get-away. Their place in Lanesville is just far enough to feel like an escape but not so far that I can't make the trip on a whim.

 While I was there, they asked me to be Olive's Godparent, which was a surprise and a joy. Since Olive came into the world in December, she's won me over with her unusual name and her mellow demeanor. We got plenty of time to bond while I was there, as she slept on my chest while I chatted with Tim and Meg and as we went out cross-country skiing in the afternoon. I love the fact that she could fall asleep strapped to Meg's chest while we skiied through woods.

The snow was falling lightly as we skied inland through an area of Cape Anne called Dogtown, a place I've been wanting to explore for a while. According to Meg, in the past the area was inhabited by a community of widows who kept dogs for protection. This summer I'd like to search for a series of rocks that have phrases engraved in them--sure to be some good stories there.
