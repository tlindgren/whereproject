Earlier this week, I took out my keys and discovered that one key inexplicably had become wedged in the ring of another one such that I could not for the life of me untangle them. It was like one of these mechanical disentanglement puzzles that I was never very good at solving. All week I wrestled with them every time I took them out, alternating between reasoned calculation and frustrated acts of force, but with no success.

Yesterday morning after finishing a rather unproductive session of dissertation writing at the coffee shop, I put the pointy ball of keys in my pocket for the ride to work. When I arrived and took them out to lock up, I noticed with some amazement that they were no longer tangled. Apparently, my peddling for 25 minutes was smarter than days of conscious effort, but at this point I wasn&#039;t complaining. 

I took it as a metaphor for writing, reminding me that sometimes writing happens best when I&#039;m trying the least. Of course, a good deal of writing happens with deliberate, focused attention on the task, but I should never discount the subconscious work of writing that often gets me through the knottier periods when I can&#039;t seem to untangle a particular ball of thoughts. Quite regularly the real writing of the morning happens either on the ride to work when the ideas are still warm from a couple hours of writing or on the ride home when thoughts re-animate themselves once I&#039;ve relaxed my white-knuckled grip on them. 

Writing is not a brain-in-a-vat activity; it is as embodied as anything else, even though it&#039;s easy to forget when I&#039;m in the mode of writing that involves putting words on the page. Biking is my favorite way to write when I&#039;m not at the computer, but running or walking or taking a shower often can work just as well--whatever method let&#039;s the body do some of the heavy lifting for a while so the mind get the sweat out of its eyes and tie its shoes before making its next sentence.
