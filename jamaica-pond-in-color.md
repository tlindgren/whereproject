Sam Blackmon has a new site call [The Jamaica Pond Project](http://jpp.samblackman.org/Welcome.html). Heres how he describes it:
> <div class="Normal" style="padding:4px;">** Life on a Smaller Scale**</div>
> <div class="Normal" style="padding:4px;">We live in [Jamaica Plain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Plain "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Plain"), a neighborhood on the south side of Boston.  One of the best parts of JP is, undoubtedly, [Jamaica Pond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Pond "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Pond"), a small, spring-fed, kettle pond.</div>
> <div class="Normal" style="padding:4px;">The pond covers about 60 acres and is 90 feet deep at its center, making it the largest body of fresh water in Boston.                                     It's ringed by a walking path that is rarely empty.</div>
> <div class="Normal" style="padding:4px;">Every time I walk around the path I try to find something different, or beautiful, or sad, or silly.  This is what I've seen.</div>
A few days ago, this photo was what I saw riding by Jamaica Pond. Hard not to miss.
