As the rements of hurricane Ivan soaked Boston for most the day on Saturday, Joel and I decided to spend a lazy day around the house, resting up for a week of siteseeing. To prepare for our trip to Cape Ann today,  we watched [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Perfect Storm</span>](http://perfectstorm.warnerbros.com/) last night, a prerequisite  that neither of us had seen and which we felt would get us in the spirit to hang out in Gloucester.  One of the first things we did on our drive around Cape Ann today was to visit the<span style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</span>Fisherman's Memorial and view the Wall of Remembrance, which lists the names of over 5000 Gloucesterman who have lost their lives at sea since 1623.
