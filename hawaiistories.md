## About Us..

Essentially, _HawaiiStories_ is a a **storytelling community**,
a gathering place where web-savvy islanders and islanders-at-heart
share their thoughts â€” be they random epiphanies, poignant
observations, anecdotes, rants, questions, lyrics, poems, or anything
else, really. Hawai`i is what ties the people together, but the things
they share cross the whole spectrum of everyday life.

Geeks would call it a &quot;community weblog&quot; or 'blog, but not in the traditional link-collecting, web-spelunking sense of **[Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/)**.  Rather, something more in the spirit of [The City Stories Project](http://www.citystories.com/), which (along with the now-defunct Surreilly.com) partially served as the inspiration for _HawaiiStories_.
