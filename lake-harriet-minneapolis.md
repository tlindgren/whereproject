This sunny Sunday afternoon I strolled around Lake Harriet after having ice cream with some friends at the Edina Creamery. As I often do when I'm in the Twin Cities visiting family, I found myself relating to this place neither as tourist or native, but as prospective resident. Whether consciously or not, I was trying to figure out if this is a place I could move after finishing my degree. Today the nice weather and outstanding public parks earned it some points.
