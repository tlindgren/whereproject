Over lunch today I attended the Brain Gain luncheon hosted by the Harvard Business School where [Katie Livingston-Vale](http://web.mit.edu/bin/cgicso?query=alias=K-livingston-vale) talked about what&#039;s happening in educational technology at MIT. In her discussion of a course on social software tools she&#039;s teaching, she mentioned a video blog she points her students to called [Drivetime](http://drivetime.ravijain.org/), a talk show filmed during Ravi Jain&#039;s commute to work. The segments themselves are great, but I&#039;m even more pleased that his route takes mirrors the one that I travel several times a week to get to Cathy&#039;s or to St. James&#039;s. Here&#039;s how Ravi describes his blog: 
> DriveTime is a video blog that I produce during my daily commute to work.
> 
> My commute to work takes me from Jamaica Plain through Coolidge Corner and on to Allston. My evening commute: Allston, brief foray into Cambridge, Fenway area, Jamaica Plain. My hope is to pick up some guests along my commute -- folks that have something going on in and around Boston.

In most episodes, picks up guests and interviews them, often to discuss an upcoming event that they are a part of. I&#039;ve only just dipped into the site but I can tell I&#039;m already hooked. Check it out.
