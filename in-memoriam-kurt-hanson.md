The Metra is the commuter train that we used to ride into Chicago from Wheaton College when we were students there, and Kurt was Andrew's high school friend who hang out with us fairly often because he lived in the area. He became a fixture in our group, the guys who lived together our senior year, even after we went our separate ways and only gathered for the occasional reunion.

![kurt](http://www.timlindgren.com/whereproject/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kurt.jpg "kurt")Kurt had a way of floating in and out of our lives, showing up unexpectedly to just hang out, whether in our dorm rooms, in my apartment in Chicago after graduating, at Andrew's 30th birthday in New Haven. Last time I hung out was in Chicago about a year and a half ago when we went to Moody's for dinner and Heartland Cafe, near where I used to live in Roger's park.

Though I didn't know Kurt well, it seemed that his life often was difficult, burdened as he was with mental illness. We feared we  might hear news like this someday, but he had a remarkable resliency that gave us hope that he would always reappear. I'm haunted by seeing his name and his cause of death stated in such a distanced, impersonal tone, and I now realize that I've gotten used to wondering, however subconsiously, when Kurt would drift in to my life again. Tragically, this time he floated too far from us, and now that he won't be able to show up again, I am diminished,
