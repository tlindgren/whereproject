This week I'm at home visiting my parents in Fargo, ND. This picture is of their house which was built in 1917 and was where my mother grew up. My parents moved there just after I moved away for college. Because I often visiting my grandparents here and because it's only 6 blocks away from the house I grewup in, this feels like as much, if not more, than our other house.
