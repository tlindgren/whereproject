Thingster is an open-source weblogging service for locative media.  It is
being developed by Anselm Hook, Tom Longson and Brad Degraf in association with
[Locative](http://locative.net) - a multi-disciplinary group of
theorists, artists and engineers exploring the implications of attaching
information to place.

Users can publish 'virtual post it notes' about any geographic location: a
street intersection, a street address, a restaurant, a hiking trail or a
geocache.

Speed and ease of use is a key feature.  The time from first seeing the
service to making that first post can be less than a minute.

The reward or 'exit strategy' for a project like Thingster is social and
environmental.  The hope is to enrich neighborhoods such that it becomes easy to
discover local services at a lower cost and to create additional environmental
awareness.
