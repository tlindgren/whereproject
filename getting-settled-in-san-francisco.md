Last night I arrived in San Francisco after along day of travelling and a hectic week. The CCCC conference began this morning and I was there bright and early for a morning workshop on blogging. 

At noon I met up with Jarrett from [Creature of the Shade](http://urbanist.typepad.com/) for my fourth installment in the &quot;conversations with place bloggers&quot; series.  I was interested in hearing how he got started blogging and what connections he makes between his writing and his sense of place. As we sat looking out over Market Street and downtown San Franscisco, our conversation ranged beyond the topic of blogging to our ideas of place more generally, to his work, and my dissertation, and along the way he offered some helpful suggestions in ways to approach my research on place blogging. I consider it one of the perks of this particular dissertation that it gives me an excuse to meet up with interesting people in intersting places, and I hope it's possible to keep it that way.
