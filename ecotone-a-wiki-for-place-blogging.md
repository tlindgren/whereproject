This evening as I was trying to decide what to submit to the [2004 Computers and Writing Conference](http://www.hawaii.edu/cw2004/) (since the deadline is this week), I ran across a great wiki on place-based blogging called "[Ecotone:" Writing about Place](http://www.magpienest.org/scgi-bin/wiki.pl?HomePage)."
Now that I know that there is as least this community, I'm inspired me to kickstart this weblog and continue my investigation into the genre of place-based blogging. Skimming through the site led me on a breathless scurry through numerous related sites and now I'm looking forward to exploring them more. But for the moment, I'm tired of being in front of the computer and since I'm feeling like going out for a walk, I know that Ecotone is the kind of site I've been looking for.
