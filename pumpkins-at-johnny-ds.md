I just stepped outside Cafenation for a bit of fresh air, and the pumpkins at Johnny D's Fruit Market were lit up brilliantly by the late morning sun. Since it looks like I won't be able to get out to a country farm stand this weekend, it's nice to have a little bit of the country right here in Brighton Center. The photo is one I took a couple years ago.
