The other night I got it in my head that I need to revise my site, and when this happens, I usually can't get it out of my head until it's done. And when I'm tweaking and redesigning, I am usually unable to write much--form wins out over content. 

But in reality, form is never separate from content, so I take my revisions as part of the overall project. I often find thinking about the design of the blog as interesting as writing in the blog, but I have a hard time doing both at once. And when the medium is under construction, this adds just enough drag on the process of posting that it's often enough to keep me from writing on a daily basis. 

Sometime in the next two weeks, Ill need to upgrade from Drupal 4.3 to 4.4.2, which will probably distract me for a bit, but before that happens I hope to get back into the posting groove again. I hope that soon I'll be able to strike a better rhythm between designing and writing so that the two activities feel more integrated.
