This last week I began the final Dissertation Smackdown, the last days of vacation I take to try to finish up the dissertation. When I have to spent extended periods of time writing, my body needs some role to play while my mind is doing most of the heavy lifting. Often my body gets involved through pacing, walking out the ideas when they get particularly troublesome. But the last few days, I&#039;ve found myself dancing rather than pacing, doing a little dissertation gig each time I feel the urge to get up. Sometimes I dance to jazz (Dave Brubeck Radio on Pandora) or more electronic stuff like the Quantic Soul Orchestra. Whatever the style, it&#039;s helped keep me from going crazy after a day of wrangling with the same intransigent ideas.   

So yesterday it seemed like a sign when **[NPR interviewed](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97356050)** someone who created a dance competition for PhD&#039;s called &quot;**[Dance Your PhD](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/319/5865/905b#dance)**.&quot; I&#039;m not sure I have time at the moment to begin choreographing my routine, but somehow it&#039;s nice to know there might be another creative outlet for this project after it begins gathering dust in the library.
