While wandering down one of the back streets of [Bearskin Neck,](http://www.cape-ann.com/bearskin.html) Rockport, I ran across this sign guarding someone's parking space. Not only is it a phonetically accurate spelling of the Gloucester accent, but also playfully reminds me of pre-pin yin phonetic approximations of Chinese. I'd love to meet the designer. Well done.
