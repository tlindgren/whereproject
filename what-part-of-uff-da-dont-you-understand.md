You know you're in Cambridge/Somerville when you overhear a guy saying loadly into his cellphone,&quot;I mean, what part of 'englightened self-interest&quot; don't they understand.'&quot; 

When I was back in Fargo a couple weeks ago, my dad greeted me at the door wearing a shirt that said, &quot;What part of 'Uff Da' don't you understand.&quot; It felt good to be home.

(For those of you unfamiliar with the term _Uff Da_, it's a [norwegan term used to express dismay, disapproval, or disgust](http://www.homestead.com/shellum/Uff_da.html). I have fond memories of my grandparents on both sides using it to express themselves. Grandma Lindgren was fond using of its variant, _Fi Da_, usually when I was teasing her about something. 

Apparently, Uff Da's now being use as a political organizing tool: &nbsp;
