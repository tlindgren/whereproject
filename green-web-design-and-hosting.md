On the day that the Kyoto Protocol is going into affect, it seems fitting to
  mention a few web design and hosting companies dedicated to promoting environmental
  responsibility in cyberspace. 

With a tag lines &quot;Connecting people and planet&quot;
    and &quot;websites powered by the wind,&quot; [Earthsite's](http://earthsite.net/) mission
    is to offer &quot;green marketing and design services with renewable energy hosting.&quot;
    This the first hosting service I've run across that uses renewable energy
    to run its business, a choice that grounds cyberspace
  in the  realities of energy use and material design.

 From this site
      I  linked to two San Francisco design firms, [Conscious
      Creative](http://consciouscreative.com/index.html) and [Digital
      Hive](http://www.digitalhive.biz/) that both aim to integrate sustainable practices with the communication
    design. Conscious Creative's site has won the &quot;[Environmentally
    Friendly Website Award](http://www.naturallyhome.com/awards.shtml)&quot; which recognizes
  &quot;websites that
                          have gone the extra mile towards making a real change
    to our environment.&quot; 

What I find interesting about these companies is their efforts to define ecological
  design not just in terms of the clients they tend to serve--environmentally
  and socially conscious organizations--but also in terms of more material issues,
  such as how they power their servers and what kinds of paper they print brochures
  on.
