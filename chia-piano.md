On our way to Cambridge on Saturday, we drove by a piano sitting in front of a large apartment building on the corner of Monmouth and Canton in Brookline. It was an older Chickering with keys missing and with a sign for "Death Wish Piano Movers" on the bench. A bed of plants had taken root on the top, prompting Cathy to suggest the title "Chia Piano" for this post. I thought it was perfect.
