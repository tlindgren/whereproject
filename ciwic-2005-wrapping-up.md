Well, the last two weeks are now a blur of class time, lab time, and socializing at various sites around the Keweenaw. The immersion experience has kept me from doing much blogging, and now I have to hit the road so that I can get back to Minneapolis before too late. Perhaps I'll have a chance later to throw some photos up. 

For now, I'll post my final Director map project (really more of a prototype, since the content is slim): 

[Map|Me](http://www.whereproject.org/files/images/ciwic2005/mapme.html) (3MB Shockwave file)

It gave me a chance to wrestle with Director, Photoshop, and Illustrator, as well as conceptualize some ways of designing multimodal place-oriented compositions. Hopefully I'll be able to work with it more as I begin transferring to Flash. 

Now what need is a long drive to begin processing my first CIWIC experience.
