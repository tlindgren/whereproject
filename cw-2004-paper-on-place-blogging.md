<span style="font-style:italic;">I presented the following paper at the </span>[Computers
  and Writing 2004](http://www.hawaii.edu/cw2004/)<span style="font-style:italic;"> conference in Honolulu,
  Hawaii, June 10-13, 2003\. This is a first run at writing about place blogging,
  so all the standard caveats apply: it's not very polished, it's meant to be
  delivered orally rather than read, etc. But I would like to make it available
  for anyone who's interested. </span>

**Blogging Place: Ecotone and the Rhetoric of Place-Based Weblogs**

Almost exactly a year ago, a handful of bloggers got together to create a wiki
  they called Ecotone: Writing about Place. The site’s expressed purpose
  was to create a community who shared an interest in writing intentionally and
  regularly about the experience of place. 

> <font color="#666666">&quot;The Ecotone wiki is intended as a portal for

In reflecting on his two years of blogging, Fred from Fragments of Floyd, a
  founding member of Ecotone, describes his experience this way: 

> **_<font color="#669966">[Fragments

Like many bloggers, Fred has found a medium to facilitate a daily
  writing practice that documents his personal experiences and connects this writing
  with an online community of interested readers. But Fred also makes clear that
  this blog has a particular theme that grows out of a particular rhetorical exigency--“Two
  years ago I began to see myself not so much by what I do for a living as where
  it is that I do my living.” This concern with whereness reflects the unique
  qualities of place blogging, a genre of online writing that takes as one of
  its central concerns the relationship between identity and place. 

However, as you can see by Fred’s post, this is no simple relationship.
  He seems to blur the distinctions between the metaphorical and literal geographies
  (What does it mean for these people who are “visiting Good Creek from
  time to time”), and he testifies to the way his blogging is connecting
  him to actual communities, even as he is quick to resist any easy binary between
  his “real” community and his online community. Fred seems to suggest
  that his practice of writing online helps connect him not only to a group of
  online writers but also to the physical places that shape him. 

As if to respond to this criticism, place blogging appears to wrestles, at
  least implicitly, with the question, “In what ways can the web connect
  us with actual places rather than disconnect us?” While place blogging
  shares many similarities with blogging in general, I will argue in this paper
  that it also has particular qualities that set it apart as a distinct genre.
  By writing regularly and attentively about their experiences of place, place
  bloggers construct a unique discursive space in which to explore the increasingly
  complex relationship between life online and life in places. By taking presenting
  a selection of Ecotone posts, I’d like to offer a quick walking tour of
  place blogging and points out a few things it can teach us both about technology
  and place in the context of writing instruction. 

* * *

I want to start with an excerpt from one of the Feathers of Hope blog co-authored
  by a couple of the Ecotone founders. Numenius reflects on these issues, specifically
  the division between the “modern spatial technologies” he often
  works with as a geographer and the “almost mystical striving for awareness
  of a particular locality” that motivates his use of a simpler technology—writing.

> **<font color="#669966">[Feather

For Numenius, two technologies, biking and writing, are particularly well suited
  for the exploration of place. As Mitchell Thomashow has pointed out, it’s
  difficult for us to develop a deep sense of place when we don’t modulate
  the pace of our perception, if we only experience places at the pace of a car
  or an airplane and not at the pace of walking or biking. And the Internet also
  seems to be part of the problem; as the “information superhighway,”
  it tends to provides us with vast amounts of information in a very short time.

However, in a comment he expresses some hope that we're not “very far
  off from having narrative-rich geographies emerge from the grassroots side of
  the Web,” by which I assume he would include both weblogs and other spatial
  technologies (perhaps some combination of both). 

* * *

What he leaves implicit here is the ways the blog is a technology that has
  the potential to alter the pace at which we engage with places. I think it does
  this in a few ways: 

**1\. Chronological organization**. The expectation for regularity
  is build into the culture of blogging in a way that encourages daily writing,
  and by extension, daily observation of the local places that the writer can
  access easily. 

There are continuities between this kind of chronological organization and
  print based genres like the journal or logbook, as Numenius’s co-blogger
  Pica observes in a post from last year. Before beginning to blog regularly,
  she and Numinius kept a detailed logbook of their house and its environs in
  which they described the weather, wildlife, gardening, and so forth. This genre
  and the impulse toward daily-ness carried over into the practice of blogging
  about place: 

> **<font color="#669966">[Feather

Clearly there on continuities with the logbook as a print-based, place oriented
  genre, but the weblog makes it easy to transfer of that writing impulse to the
  web: 

**2\. Easily updated with short, informal posts. **The ease of
  posting to a weblog minimizes the obstacles to writing regularly. It’s
  more important to write something short fairly often that to write long polished
  pieces only a couple times a month. 

But of course, Pica also points out one of the important differences made possible
  by weblog technology: 

**3\. The ability to construct an audience of interested readers, often
  reading from a geographical distance.**

Chris Corrigan, whose Bowen Island Journal, documents life on a small Island
  off the coast of Vancouver, reflects in similar ways on the significance of
  audience for his place blog: 

> _**<font color="#669966">[Bowen

The construction of an audience is central to blogging about place, but in
  complicated ways. When we think place-based, we might assume that the values
  of writing about the place and for the people in that place might be necessarily
  go together. However, it appears that place bloggers write as much for a “global”
  audience as for a local one. 

There’s nothing surprising about this, insofar as Ecotone is a community
  of interest like so many other communities on the web. This is after all what
  the web is all about, at least according to utopian rhetoric of the web that
  trumpets the advantages of online communities organized by common interest that
  transcend the geographic limitations of place-based communities. The web allows
  us to escape the tyranny of the local and pursue our interests where ever they
  may lead us. 

Without denying this element of online experience, we also must acknowledge
  that the way we actually use the web is often very local in nature, even if
  just for such simple activities as finding the location of nearby stores, movie
  times, or information about local organizations. Place-blogging appears to occupy
  a space somewhere between community of interest and place-based community, but
  what’s unique about place blogging is the intentional connection it makes
  between online experience and life in places. 

So I think we can make a couple observations about the nature of audience in
  place blogging: 

> **The place blog makes use of the ability of the blog to transcend
>     the limits of proximity to create a community of interest, but doesn't make
>     this an end in itself. **This I think ties in with the rhetorical exigency

>     that the experience of mobility and the desire to intentionally construct
>     a sense of place out of the places they inhabit appear to be primary motivations
>     for blogging. 
> 
> **Because an important rhetorical exigency for place blogging seems

>     fresh eyes.

**Ecotone Biweekly Topics: Heuristics for invention**

What theses bloggers highlight is the cultural context many of us are writing
  out of: As we move more often and as places around us change more quickly, we
  not longer can take place for granted. Sense of place is less often inherited
  than it is intentionally constructed.

In this context, blogging about place serves as a kind of heuristic for the
  invention of a place sense. Not only does a place-oriented blog provide a regular
  impetus to examine one’s sense of place in writing, but the [Ecotone
  Biweekly Topics](http://www.magpienest.org/scgi-bin/wiki.pl?BiWeeklyTopics) build this into the culture of the online community of writers.

Every two weeks, Ecotone bloggers write about a common topic in their blogs
  and link to these posts from the Ecotone site:

The place blog tends to create a rhetorical rhythm between life online and
  life in places by offering, and the daily and informality of writing about place
  in a weblog format means that our pace of observation takes on a more deliberate
  pace. And the fact that this can be easily shared with others begins to create
  networks of place-people whose writing inspires us to write more. 

* * *

**Tensions of Place Blogging**

Of course, blogging about place does not guarantee that this rhetorical rhythm
  will be effortless. At the core of place blogging as a writing practice is the
  conflict between the time one spends in front of the computer writing and the
  time when spends out exploring actual places, a tension articulated by Maria
  in a recent post: 

> **<font color="#669966">[Alembic:

This is the dilemma that all place bloggers struggle with, but I think it is
  ultimately a productive tension that makes this practice of writing unique.
  Everyone struggles with it in different ways and there are seasons of practice,
  phases when one swings to one side or the other. To be a healthy place blogger,
  I think you always have to be able to walk away from the computer, for days
  or weeks, when necessary, as Frank from Bicycle Communing Now did last week:

**Observations**

**1\. Rhetorical Traits**

*   Rhetorical exigency

        Place bloggers often write in response to the experience of mobility and as
    a way of constructing a sense of place.
*   Audience

        Bloggers write about place, but not exclusively for readers from the places
    they inhabit. In fact, writing for a geographically disparate audience and
    reading place bloggers from all over the world plays an important role in
    the practice of place-blogging.*   Heuristic for Invention

        Place blogging functions as a collaborative heuristic device for creating
    local knowledge and constructing a sense of place.
*   Rhetorical effectiveness

        For a place blog to be successful, it must persuade people to leave it.

**2\. Tentative definitions**

*   If a weblog can be defined as “a website organized by time,”
    then a place blog as a weblog organized by place.*   A mode of online literacy that encourages a regular encounter with the ordinary
    places one inhabits and reflection on the relationship between place and identity
*   A trans-geographic online community of interest whose goal is not to transcend
    geography

**3\. Pedagogical Implications**

> *   The importance of writing as a daily discipline
> *   the collaborative nature of writing (writing with and for others)
> *   the personal role of writing in non-academic settings (yes, people write

> *   The representation of the mind at work (like personal essays, blogs represent
>       not just the product of thought, but the process of thinking)

* * *

**Parting Thoughts**

As places change more quickly and we move more often, does the construction
  of community online become compensatory mechanism to make up for the fact that
  we longer invest in local communities? In his book _The Wired Neighborhood_,
  Stephen Dohery Farina, expresses his fear that “the continual virtualization
  of community reveals that geophysical community is dying. As we invest ourselves
  in the simulation, the simulated phenomena disappear” (27). 

In a recent post in Fragments of Floyd, Fred describes his discovery that someone
  had dumped a 55 gallon drum of waste oil into Goose Creek, which runs through
  his property. He concludes his post with this reflection: 

> **<font color="#669966">[Fragments

Here we see a place blogger who is not interested in creating online communities
  as a way of compensating for the loss of actual communities and environments.
  While Cynthia Selfe has warned us of “The perils of Not Paying Attention”
  to technology; perhaps it's equally perilous if our technologies do not encourage
  us to pay attention to the places we inhabit. Place blogging has the potential
  to help us pay attention to both places and online technologies, and to complicate
  our understanding of both in the process.
