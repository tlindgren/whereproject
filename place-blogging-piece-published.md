A couple weeks ago, my piece &quot;[Blogging Places: Locating Pedagogy in the Whereness of Weblogs](http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/10.1/binder2.html?coverweb/lindgren/index.htm)&quot; in the journal [_Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedoagogy_](http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/10.1/index.html). I wouldn't have been able to do this without all the generous input I received from numerous place bloggers, especially the Ecotone folks. So thanks everyone for your feedback and interest during the process of writing this. 

I'm now in the process of filling out sections of this as I plow ahead with the larger dissertation process. So some of you will likely be hearing from me again...
